<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a PhD student at Stanford University, advised by [Judith Fan](https://profiles.stanford.edu/judith-fan). 

My research focuses on the intersection of human and machine intelligence. I am particularly interested in the process of learning by thinking -- how humans and machines can improve their reasoning without any additional data or feedback from the outside world. More broadly, my goal is to formalize the computational principles behind human intelligence, and use such insights to interpret and improve the reasoning and decision-making capacities of artificial systems. 

Prior to coming to Stanford, I spent a wonderful year as a Pre-doctoral Fellow at Harvard University, collaborating with [Sam Gershman](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/samuel-j-gershman) and [Fiery Cushman](https://cushmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/). Before that, I earned a master's degree in statistics with a focus on statistical machine learning at the University of Oxford, where I worked with [Jakob Foerster](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/), [Christian Schroeder de Witt](https://schroederdewitt.com/), and [Chris Summerfield](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/people/christopher-summerfield). 

Before I discovered the intersection of machine learning and cognitive science, I was a research analyst working with [Paul Romer](https://paulromer.net/about/) at NYU, where we focused on tech policy, cryptography, and economic research. I graduated from the Dual Bachelor's progam between Columbia University (BA in Economics) and Institut d'Ã©tudes politiques de Paris (BA in Politics, Philosophy and Economics).
